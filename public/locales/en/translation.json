    "paragraph1": "This app takes the text input from <b>Encrypt</b> field and writes it to the metadata of a newly created PNG file that is generated from the <b>Canvas</b>. The canvas image depicts the message as binary data: nodes that are filled represent 1's and nodes that are outlined represent 0's. If someone was patient enough, they could translate the message back to text just by interpreting the image as unicode values. That's why there is a <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faLock} className='px-1' /> toggle that deteremines whether the message is embedded with 128-bit AES encryption or as plain text.",
    "paragraph2": "Once you click <b>Save</b> or <b>Post</b>, the file will be downloaded to your device or posted to the <b>Feed</b>, respectively. Whomever you share the image with would be able to extract and decipher the text by dragging the PNG file into the <b>Decrypt</b> zone and entering the passkey you provided them with, if it's encrypted. Likewise, you'll be able to decipher whichever posts you possess the password for.",
    "paragraph3": "I realise that nobody asked for this, I just made it as a fun way to send secret messages to the people who visit my site <a className='text-orange hover:underline dark:text-orange' href='https://www.alifeinbinary.com'>alifeinbinary.com</a> and thought it would be a fun project to share as open source for those who are wanting to learn about the technology within."
